Unless your project is new, the build file generated by default will need some editing before you can build, so take a look at it and adjust whatever is necessary (e.g. package name, version, dependencies).

#### Build.kt contents

* imports
* project declaration(s) using the project <i>directive</i>
* Since it's a Kotlin file, it can also contain any class or function you need

#### Directives

within each project declaration you can use these directives:

- dependencies
- dependenciesTest
- packaging
  - jar
    - fatJar
- publishing


{% highlight kotlin %}
import com.beust.kobalt.*
 
val kobalt = project {
    name = "kobalt"
    group = "com.beust"
    artifactId = name
    version = "0.62"
    directory = homeDir("kotlin/kobalt")
}
{% endhighlight %}
