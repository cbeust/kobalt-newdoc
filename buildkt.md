##Edit kobalt/src/Build.kt
  Unless your project is new, the build file generated by default will need some editing before you can build, so take a look at it and adjust whatever is necessary (e.g. package name, version, dependencies).

  Build.kt contains imports, the declaration of one or more projects and the declaration of additional configurations (e.g. dependencies, packaging, publishing, etc...). Since it's a Kotlin file, it can also contain any class or function you need

{% highlight kotlin %}
import com.beust.kobalt.*
 
val kobalt = project {
    name = "kobalt"
    group = "com.beust"
    artifactId = name
    version = "0.62"
    directory = homeDir("kotlin/kobalt")
}
{% endhighlight %}
